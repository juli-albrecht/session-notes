# Basic Git Commands
## Create directories and navigate trough shell
- mkdir _filename_: Create directory üìÅ
- touch _filename.txt_: Create file (in this case text-file) üìÑ
- cd _filename_: Change directory to _filename_ 
- cd ..: Move one directory up 
- cd ~: Move to home directory
- tree: Tree-structure of directories and files in selected directory
- ls: List all directories and files in selected directory

## Move, delete and copy directories and files
- cp -R|--recursive _filename_: Copy directory/ file
- mv _filename_: Move directory/ file
- mv _filename, old_ _filename, new_: Change name of directory/ file
- rmdir _filename_: Delete empty directory
- rm -r|--recursive _filename_: Delete directory including contents

## Reading files
- cat _filename.txt_: Print all contents
- open _filename.txt_: Open file in the default editor

## Workflow to push to or pull from github
1. In the local `web-challenges` repository, make sure you are on the `main` branch.
2. Create a folder with the name of the session. For example, `mkdir css-basic`.
3. Navigate to the folder created in step 2 `cd css-basics`.
4. Once you are inside the folder, download the challenge (using the npx command).This creates a new folder belonging to that challenge.
5. Change into that folder, e.g. `cd css-basics-pink-box`.
6. Open that folder with Visual Studio Code `code .`. From here it's easiest to use the Visual Studio Code Terminal `CMD + J`
7. Switch to a new branch for this challenge, e.g. `git switch -c feature/css-basics-pink-box`. 
8. Do an initial commit `git add .` `git commit -m "initial commit"`.
9. Work on the challenge. You can do some commits from time to time.
10. Once you have finished the challenge commit and push all changes to Github `git push -u origin feature/css-basics-pink-box`.
11. Open a browser and go to your Github repository. Create a new Pull Request.
12. Copy the URL from the browser and send it to a team member and ask for a review (if you like)
13. Merge the PR on Github and delete the feature branch.
14. In VS Code switch to the main branch `git switch main`.
15. Pull the changes from Github `git pull`.
16. Delete the local feature branch `git branch -d feature/css-basics-pink-box`.
17. Close VS Code and in your terminal change into the sessions folder. Repeat all steps with the next challenge.

## Create new branches
- git switch -c _branchname_: Creates new branch
